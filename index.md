Greetings! I am a Senior Associate Researcher at [NEC Data Science team](http://www.nec-labs.com/research-departments/data-science/data-science-home) in Princeton NJ. 

I received my B.Eng in Electronic and Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University and my Ph.D in Computer Science from Stony Brook University, under the supervision of Hong Qin.

During my PhD study, I was fortunate enough to work with [Steven Skiena](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/), [Leman Akoglu](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lakoglu/) and [Yifan Hu](http://yifanhu.net/).

My personal research interests include sparse graph representation, semi-supervised learning and online learning algorithms, large scale machine learning, data stream mining and graph mining. 

This is my [CV]() and [Google scholar]().
